The Delhi Metro Route Planner is developed in C++ using STL containers like unordered_map, vector, and priority_queue to model the metro network as a weighted graph. It implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between stations. The code features a simple console-based interface for user input and displays the optimal route, travel time, and fare. The modular structure ensures easy maintenance and future scalability
